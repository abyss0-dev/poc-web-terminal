// Package runtime defines the transport-neutral Runtime and Session contract
// that the Gateway depends on, together with a QEMU implementation that
// realises a Session as an SSH connection with an allocated PTY.
//
// The contract has two responsibilities — lifecycle (launch and stop backend
// machines) and session (open an interactive byte stream to one machine). A
// future Kata / Kubernetes / cloud implementation can satisfy the same
// interfaces without changing the Gateway, the BFF, or the wire protocol.
